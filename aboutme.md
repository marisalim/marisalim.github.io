I am a bioinformatics training postdoc at UC Davis, where I am developing bioinformatics and biomedical data science training materials for the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem.

My research interests have covered a range of topics from conservation genetics and high-elevation adaptation to species identification tool optimization. I currently think about how to improve computational biology training for researchers!
