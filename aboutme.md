Hello! My research interests have covered a range of topics from conservation genetics and high-elevation adaptation to species identification tool optimization.

Before this...
- Bioinformatics training postdoc at UC Davis in [Dr. C. Titus Brown's lab](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/), developing bioinformatics and biomedical data science training materials for the [NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem](https://www.nih-cfde.org/) to improve computational biology training for researchers! :)
- Bioinformaticist at the Bronx Zoo in Dr. Tracie Seimon's lab, with the Wildlife Conservation Society's [Zoological Health Program](https://oneworldonehealth.wcs.org/Initiatives/Zoological-Health-Program.aspx) and [Molecular Diagnostics Program](https://oneworldonehealth.wcs.org/Initiatives/WCS-Molecular-Program.aspx)  
- Ph.D. in December 2018 from the [Department of Ecology and Evolution](https://www.stonybrook.edu/ecoevo/) at Stony Brook University, mentored by [Dr. Liliana M. DÃ¡valos](https://lmdavalos.github.io/) and [Dr. Catherine Graham](https://www.wsl.ch/en/employees/graham.html)
- B.A. in [Integrative Biology](https://ib.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. I spent lots of time at the [Museum of Vertebrate Zoology](https://mvz.berkeley.edu/) and [Evolutionary Genetics Lab](https://mvz.berkeley.edu/genetics-lab/), mentored by Dr. Craig Moritz and his lab, Dr. Jim Patton, and the [Grinnell Resurvey Project team](https://mvz.berkeley.edu/Grinnell/index.html)!
