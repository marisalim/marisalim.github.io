Hello!

My research interests have covered a range of topics from conservation genetics and high-elevation adaptation to species identification tool optimization. I am currently a bioinformatics training postdoc at UC Davis, where I develop bioinformatics and biomedical data science training materials for the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem. I spend my time thinking about how to improve computational biology training for researchers!

Before this...

- I was a bioinformaticist at the Bronx Zoo with the Wildlife Conservation Society's [Zoological Health Program](https://oneworldonehealth.wcs.org/Initiatives/Zoological-Health-Program.aspx) and [Molecular Diagnostics Program](https://oneworldonehealth.wcs.org/Initiatives/WCS-Molecular-Program.aspx).  
- I got my PhD in December 2018 from the [Department of Ecology and Evolution](https://www.stonybrook.edu/ecoevo/) at Stony Brook University, mentored by [Dr. Liliana DÃ¡valos](https://lmdavalos.github.io/) and [Dr. Catherine Graham](https://www.wsl.ch/en/employees/graham.html).
- I got my Bachelor's in [Integrative Biology](https://ib.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley and spent lots of time at the [Museum of Vertebrate Zoology](https://mvz.berkeley.edu/) and [Evolutionary Genetics Lab](https://mvz.berkeley.edu/genetics-lab/)!
