I am currently a bioinformatics training postdoc at UC Davis, where I am developing bioinformatics and biomedical data science training materials for the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem.

I am broadly interested in the evolutionary patterns and processes that shape diversity and species distribution. For my dissertation research, I studied the evolution of genetic adaptation to high altitude conditions in Andean hummingbirds.
