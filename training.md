## DIB lab and the NIH CFDE

In the [National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Training and Engagement Team](https://www.nih-cfde.org/) and as a member of the [Lab for Data Intensive Biology](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/), my role has been to co-create a training program to equip researchers with computational skills to better find, access, interoperate, and reuse data and tools. Check out our lessons and resources!
